# pyspark-regression

This project uses PySpark on the Databricks platform to predict Paris real estate prices on the [Paris Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction) Kaggle dataset.

The main steps are outlined below:

- **Part 1 : Problem Definition, Kaggle Competition selected and why**
- **Part 2 : Data Exploration, Feature Engineering and Data Preparation** - Data exploration is carried out using SQL querries and their associated graphs
- **Part 3:  Model creation** - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor models were built ... cross val + hyperparam tunning
- **Part 4: Model Evaluation and Explanations of Decision**
- **Part 5: Discussion of work completed, competition outcomes, and highlighting features of Spark used**


  
Data exploration using SQL queries and associated graphs, feature engineering and selection and data preparation were carried out. Multiple models were built (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor) using hyperparameter tuning and evaluated on commonly used metrics, analyzing the residuals.

R squared, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Explained Varriance

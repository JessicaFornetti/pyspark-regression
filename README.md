# pyspark-regression

This project uses PySpark on the Databricks platform to predict Paris real estate prices on the [Paris Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction) Kaggle dataset.


Data exploration using SQL queries and associated graphs, feature engineering and selection and data preparation were carried out. Multiple models were built (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor) using hyperparameter tuning and evaluated on commonly used metrics, analyzing the residuals.
